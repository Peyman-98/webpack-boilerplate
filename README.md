## Development

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
$ npm run dev

# run all tests
$ npm run test

# build for production with minification and serve dist files at localhost:8080
$ npm run build
```

In development, if you are working with a backend like [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), you will need to add a script to your template file:

```html
...
<script src="http:/[localhost|ip]:[port]/app.js"></script>
...
```

Use `IP` if you run your app from external devices.
